This app is for COVID safety and risk analysis by tracking CO2 concentrations. I've consulted with respiratory infection specialists, indoor air quality specialists, who are all advocates of measuring CO2 levels indoors as a proxy for ventilation effectiveness, and thus, the risk of COVID containing aerosols building up.

Currently, I use three google services. I use Google Places, Maps, and Sign In. For Places, I rely on the place_id, and only plan to cache coodinates for 30 days as per the API ToS, and I currently I use no other OAuth login provider, as relying on a single source of federated identity drastically reduces code complexity, and allows me to deploy this app and help people sooner, during a raging pandemic. Google is, of course, the best that I know, with the widest reach. I currently store the unique sub field as a UID, I store user email as a convenience to give some indication to the user during initial rendering. I plan to display the name as attached to measurement.
