This app is designed for sharing measurements with the public at large. I may use said measurements and associated data in any legal way that I see fit.

By design, nothing you upload will be kept private. This may change in the future, but this is very much the entire spirit of this app.

When you log in with google, I store only 3 pieces of the information returned:
    1. The email address associated with your google account, if it's not already stored. I currently do not update on changes. 
    2. The name associated with your google account, if it's not already stored. I currently do not update on changes.
    3. The permanent unique identifier that google produces for identifying you uniquely in this application. (The 'sub' OAuth field).

Items 1 and 2 are not strictly necessary for the basic functioning of the app, but it makes for a nice user experience. These are not currently displayed anywhere publicly in the app, but likely will be in the future.

Item #3, the unique identifier, is central to the functioning of the app, as it lets me implement login without adding to the infinite misery people already have with passwords. I thus do not need to even store passwords.

I will not sell any of this information. I hate spam.

Clever hackers and criminals MIGHT be able to use any data you post for malicious activities, as they can with any freely available information; be warned.  

For GDPR compliance, I will in the future implement a way to delete all of your data. The app is currently an early prototype, and I simply haven't implemented it yet. You also have a right to copies of your data, though I have not yet implemented automated export functionality. Contact me if you have a need for that. I have a right to charge small, reasonable, fees for that work.

I reserve the right to run ads in the future, even though it's not why I am building this. There may be privacy implications for this, and I will update these terms accordingly.

If you use geolocation, I do NOT store that data.

These terms are subject to change.

My email address is test35965 [[a t]] gmail.com. You may alternately reach me at alexander [[a t]] riccio.com, though that email simply routes to my gmail.
